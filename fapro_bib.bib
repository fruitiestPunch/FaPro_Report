abstract = {Most ISPs use sophisticated traffic engineering strategies based on link weight optimizations to efficiently provision their backbone network and to serve intra-domain traffic. While traditionally, traffic is split among the shortest weighted paths using ECMP, recently, an additional dimension for optimization arose in the context of segment routing: traffic can be steered away from congested shortest paths by inserting intermediate destinations, so-called waypoints.This paper investigates the benefits of jointly optimizing the link weights and waypoints for traffic engineering both analytically and empirically. In particular, we formulate the joint optimization problem and formally quantify the benefits of joint optimizations over separate link-weights and waypoints optimizations, using a rigorous analysis. We also present an efficient joint optimization algorithm and evaluate its performance in realistic and synthetic scenarios.},

abstract={The failures of multiple elements in a network can have disastrous consequences on its operation. Therefore, understanding the robustness of networks that experience multiple failures is utterly important. In this chapter, we review well-defined metrics related to the topology and resilience of the network and use them to analyze the robustness of real-world networks under multiple failures. We consider 52 real-world networks from three different infrastructure domains, namely metro networks, power grids and telecommunication networks. We quantify the impact of targeted node removals from a network on the relative size of the largest connected component of the network. Nodes are attacked according to traditional centrality metrics, such as degree, betweenness, closeness and the principal adjacency matrix eigenvector. In addition, we consider attacks based upon the recently proposed ``zeta-vector'', that is the diagonal elements of the pseudo-inverse of the Laplacian matrix. Finally, we compare and rank these node-removal strategies and apply to the selected set of real-world infrastructures.},
