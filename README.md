# ReadMe
This repository only serves to host the final report of the routing algorithms course. It is linked to [Project 1](https://github.com/fruitiestPunch/FaPro_P1) and [Project 2](https://github.com/fruitiestPunch/FaPro_P2), also part of the course.

The project was made using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and an [ACM-compliant template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-generic-journal-manuscript-template/yffvrvzbhhpt).

The repo only contains the root folder of the latex document.

The **[PDF](fapro_report.pdf)** contains the report.
